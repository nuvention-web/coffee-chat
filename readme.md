Overview
----------
We simplify your development program by cutting out the tedious matching process with our algorithm, allowing your team members to better achieve their goals. We help companies who are  serious about their employeesâ€™ growth manage, track, and facilitate internal professional development programs

Make Connections: Automatically or manually match people on your team to align  to your program goals

Manage Development: See who is matching, when they are  matching and how they respond to their match

Improve Performance: Improve your development programs based on the feedback from the matches in the system



Progress
----------
Our front and back ends are fully integrated on a web platform

Initial Setup
---------
To setup the submodules, pull the coffee-chat repository by running:

```
git clone https://github.com/nuvention-web/coffee-chat.git
```

This should create a local copy of the repository with each of the submodules as directories. Each of these directories should be empty. Run the following commands to initialize the submodules and pull the most recent code.

```
$ git submodule init
$ git submodule update
```

For each submodule, this should pull the most recent repo. 

Development
---------
To develop using these submodules, use each submodule directory as you would a regular git repository. Be sure to check that you are within a submodule directory before pushing changes. And as for any other development process, make sure you are on your own feature branch. 

Note:
The head of the submodule is separate from master and dev for each submodule. For any submodule, be sure to checkout dev and branch off of dev before continuing development. Check your current branch with:

```
$ git branch
```
