###Prerequisites:
Be sure to have git installed.

####Install Git on a Mac:
The easiest way to install git is through the Xcode Command Line Tools. On Mavericks (10.9) or above you can do this simply by trying to run git from the Terminal the very first time. If you donâ€™t have it installed already, it will prompt you to install it.

####Install Git on Linux:
```
$ sudo apt-get install git-all
```

###Mac Setup:
Download and install the latest version Node from the [Node](http://nodejs.org/en/) website.

Clone the repository
```
$ git clone https://github.com/nuvention-web/coffee-chat.git
```

Navigate to the "webApp" directory, where the "package.json" file exists and run the following command to install dependencies.
```
$ npm install
```

You should be all setup!

###Linux Setup:
Depending on your operating system you may need to use yum instead of apt-get to install dependencies.

Install Node via apt-get.
```
$ sudo apt-get install nodejs
```

Clone the repository
```
$ git clone https://github.com/nuvention-web/coffee-chat.git
```

Navigate to the "webApp" directory, where the "package.json" file exists and run the following command to install the Node dependencies.

```
$ npm install
```

You should be good to go!
